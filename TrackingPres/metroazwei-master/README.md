# metroazwei
A modern LaTeX Beamer theme for the A2 collaboration

MetroA2 is derived from [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), with changes made to colour, 
a hard-coded A2-Logo in the upper right corner and some slight chances to the design itself.

The demo code also includes some useful features you can use if you want to!

For a sample take a look [here](https://github.com/A2-Collaboration/metroazwei/blob/master/demo/demo.pdf)

## Installation
Download / clone this repository and put the theme files (including the white A2 logo) into:

'~/texmf/tex/latex/metroazwei'

For more information about the usage take a look into the Demo presentation.

## Documentation
For Documentation please refer to the [manual][] of the original Metropolis theme.
